I setup a replicating layer system, for fast mirroring at the raw Context2D level.

You will need to replicate both the drag layer and any other areas you wan to replicate. Setting up is a little hackish, but this shows setting a simple 200, 200 zoomed out mirror. The impl within is fairly clean and self contained.
LienzoPanel panel = new LienzoPanel(200, 200);
RootPanel.get().add(panel);

Layer replicatingLayer = new Layer();
panel.add(replicatingLayer);


replicatingLayer.getCanvasElement();
replicatingLayer.getContext().scale(0.2, 0.2);

Layer replicatingDragLayer = panel.getViewport().getDragLayer();
replicatingDragLayer.getContext().scale(0.2, 0.2);

panel = new LienzoPanel( new Viewport(1000, 1000, replicatingDragLayer) );
RootPanel.get().add(panel);

layer = new Layer();
layer.setReplicatedLayer(replicatingLayer);
panel.add( layer );

I think the overlay replication is not quite yet, so that needs fixing still. Also I think it would be good to be able to draw an additional rectangle, that represents the zoomed in viewport of the source against the zoomed out but scaled replication.
