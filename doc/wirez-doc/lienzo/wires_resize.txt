Mark - Lienzo RESIZE + TEXT on wires
**************************************

<conan> hiy8a
<conan> just checking how lienzo is going?
<roger600> hiya!
<roger600> making some progress :)
<roger600> i have added mor properties, handlers (such as resize, etc) 
<roger600> on the lienzo size added some features such as text on wires
<conan> ok on the shape?
<conan> or the lines?
<roger600> shapes
<conan> ok
<conan> I was working on hte lines
<conan> then stopped
<conan> as that requires some lienzo work
<roger600> yes!
<roger600> texts was easier :)
<conan> to calculate line line lengths
<conan> yes
<roger600> exactly
<conan> not sure what you did for text
<conan> but my idea there was to just support adding of any lienzo shape with relative positioning
<conan> so you can put it top left
<conan> bottom right
<roger600> depending on the multipath bounding box
<conan> centre
<roger600> at center of it
<conan> bottom centre
<roger600> yes
<roger600> i want to add more positions
<conan> but it could be text or an icon
<roger600> yeah ok
<conan> o in my api
<conan>  ijust delegated that to group.add()
<conan> I think instead we need something like
<conan> addChild( child, position )
<roger600> hmmm
<roger600> yes
<roger600> makes sense
<roger600> i added a new method...
<conan> then an enumeration for each of the positions
<roger600> setText
<roger600> but will refactor
<conan> there should be a padding, for anything that is edge aligned
<conan> edge padding
<roger600> i was doing it quickly just to be able to use if for wires
<conan> yeah if  was going ot add text, to say the centre
<conan> it would be
<roger600> okkk
<conan> add/setChild( text, Position.CENTER )
<conan> possible set for now
<conan> we don't want to have to deal with more than one shape in a given position
<roger600> okk
<roger600> sounds good
<conan> roger600  btw you might want to od the resize event
<conan> and submit it as a PR to dean
<conan> i think without this, things are going to get messy
<conan> https://github.com/ahome-it/lienzo-core/wiki/Wires
<conan> Maybe have a generalised start/action/end Handler interface, with a "type". Where type is drag, resize etc.
<roger600> yes!
<roger600> i have added the resize feature for wires
<roger600> and it's not working fine
<roger600> as the resze in lienzo is not working fine wiht magnets
<roger600> so still missing this point on lienzo side
<roger600> yes i can fix it np
<roger600> but my concern is about
<roger600> what we should commit to lienzo core....
<roger600> i mean
<roger600> genmymodel
<roger600> if they are using lienzo
<roger600> they might have their own version, irght?
<roger600> they have all the miissing features and fixes that we need on lienzo
<conan> ok firstly there is the generic resize handler/listener
<conan> you got a github link
<conan> to show what you did?
<conan> the generalised aspect
<conan> should go into lienzo now
<conan> as we need dean to approve that
<conan> but yes i'm tempted to do all our wires stuff 
<conan> in our own fork
<conan> for a little while
<roger600> yes me either :)
<roger600> i was just thinking on add a modulje on top of lienzo
<roger600> adding there our new stuff
<roger600> and we will see what we can integrate into lienzo core 
<roger600> i don't have a link to github to show you the lienzo features right now, they are just working on wirez, not on my lienzo test webapp
<roger600> but i can do it in order to show to dean a quick example
<conan> ok
<conan> mostly because I suspect you don't undersatnd what I mean
<conan> by make something generic that works like drag, but takes the "type" as an argument
<conan> as it needs to be integrated in the lienzo event handlers core
<roger600> which argument type?
<roger600> not following you right now yes sorry
<roger600> for resize you mean?
<roger600> so adding a drag handler for a given type?
<conan> yes
<conan> i'll be easiest
<conan> once I can see your code
<conan> and I'll try and talk you through it
<roger600> ok
<conan> but i'd suggest maybe do that now
<roger600> good
<roger600> okkk
<conan> because I'd like to get that into lienzo core
<roger600> np
<conan> if dean will accept it
<roger600> ok np
<conan> it's not wires related
<roger600> yes
<roger600> resize applies to multipaths only
<roger600> right?
<conan> for now
<roger600> ok
<roger600> another quiestion
<roger600> for now there are always 4 resize control points, right? alwasys 4
<roger600> no matter what the multipath should be
<conan> I htink so
<conan> you could potentially have more
<conan> because instead of doing a corner
<conan> you could do a side
<conan> some systems have that
<conan> so you end up with 8
<roger600> ok
<roger600> yes
<roger600> ok just asking
<conan> you know actually leave the idea of a genic lienzo resize thing
<conan> stick with what you have for now
<conan> so just keep going in the way you were
<roger600> ok
<conan> until I've had time to fully review things
<roger600> ok
