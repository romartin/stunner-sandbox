so look in WiresShapeDragHandler and DockingAndContainmentHandler
so at the end
it says addShapeToParent
and
what you need to do
is record the start dock/parent
if they changed
then you have an undock
or an uncontainment
so you want a listener
DockChangeHandler
ContainmentChangeHandler
and all you are doing really
is checking when those properties change

Me: why not adding those methods on same acceptor ifaces?
    IDockingAcceptor & IContaintmentAcceptor
    ?

yeah
that's good too
so I guess maybe do an acceptor then
changeAcceptor
make sure it has two refereces
previous and now
so if change is not allowed
it won't even detach

it might allow you to move it around the parent
but the adjust will fail
if you go outside of the parent

so, if we do not allow something to undock
the adjust method
should fail and now allow it to move otuside of the border/body
but it will still allow it to move around a valid location

so it can chagne x/y as long as the existing parent/dock value doesn't change
make sure oyu record parent/dock values on drag start

    Me: you raised a good point.... allow / deny undock. I was just considering how detect undock hehe, you go further nice, I had not considered this
    
Im not sure we have the use case
not sure as well

but no harm in doing it

-> Do this on lienzo side
